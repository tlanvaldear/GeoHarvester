## Displaying new differences
> Visualization chart on nodes In/out/InOut degree and differences between all years
>
> Visualization chart on Node groups, by successors on a selected node.
>
> Visualization on Node groups on a concentric-circled graph
>
> Try to make some auto analysis on what kind of GIS the selected node will harvest, and who would harvest it.
>> Try to make a family graph out of it, meaning that any same-harvesting node would be on the same metaNode.
>
> Start analysis out of everything.
