## 06/19 -
> Started Neo4j + SigmaJS implementation
>
> Added forceAtlas layout
>
> Created repository
>

## 06/20 -
> Corrected issues with forceAtlas and overlapping nodes/edges using sigma.Noverlap
>
> Started camera centering on selected node
>> **TODO** Open multiple graphs (such as `2015 && 2017`), and link them together ~~(node.name ?)~~
>
> **TODO** Use Tulip script that makes metaNodes in order to create the families inside the graph
>> Try to display the graph as descending circles
>
> Split-screen and start for graph correlation
>> **Known issue** : borders are useless :frowning:

## 06/21 -
> Corrected another issue with forceAtlas (I don't know how, every other day it just comes back to the "idk, just making everything bounce the hell out of it" state...)
>
> Camera centering on all instances
>
> Graph click connected to every single one
>> **Known issue** : clicking on one graph's node and clicking on the blank part of an other won't clean the first one's edge color.
>
> Border fix by putting coresponding _year_ under its *div*
>
