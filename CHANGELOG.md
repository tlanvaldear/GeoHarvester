## 06/20 - 
> Corrected issues with forceAtlas and overlapping nodes/edges using sigma.Noverlap
>
> Started camera centering on selected node
>> **TODO** Open multiple graphs (such as `2015 && 2017`), and link them together (node.name ?)
>
> **TODO** Use Tulip script that makes metaNodes in order to create the families inside the graph
>> Try to display the graph as descending circles
>
> Split-screen and start for graph correlation
>> Known issue : borders are useless :frowning:
